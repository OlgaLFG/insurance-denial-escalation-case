## Summary
This document presents a structured evaluation of a real-world case transformed into an OpenEval-compatible UX benchmark. The case documents a physicianâ€™s experience navigating algorithmic gatekeeping, non-specialist peer review, and bureaucratic delays while advocating for guideline-based IL-17 inhibitor therapy for a patient with axial spondyloarthritis.

The case has been fully documented, visualized, and archived as a reproducible, educational, and advocacy-level artifact.
